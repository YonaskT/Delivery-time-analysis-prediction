# Delivery-time-prediction
Accurate food order delivery time prediction is crucial for enhancing customer satisfaction and optimizing operations.

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of forecasting delivery times. By identifying and analyzing key factors influencing delivery speed, companies can improve service reliability and transparency. To build this predictive model, various factors were examined, including the distance between the restaurant and customer, to uncover their impact on delivery time.
